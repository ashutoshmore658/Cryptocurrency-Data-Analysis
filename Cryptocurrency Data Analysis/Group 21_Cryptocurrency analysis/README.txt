PRE-REQUISITES
------------------------
All the code files are coded using Python (Version 3.9.2). We have used the following libraries in our code:
(1)Pandas
(2)Numpy
(3)Matplotlib
(4)Plotly
(5)Quandl
(6)Pandas_datareader
(7)Seaborn
(8)Scipy
(9)Mpl-finance
(10)Time
(11)CSV

RUNNING THE CODE FILES
---------------------------------------
We have 15 code files for analysing 15 different questions. The path for these code file is "Group 21_Cryptocurrency Data analysis/Analysis".
Each file can be run in terminal/command prompt using "filename.py" command.
The output for each of these files can be a "CSV" file or an "html" showing the results of our analysis.
The datasets required to run these files are also stored in the same path.
All the output files are stored in "Group 21_Cryptocurrency Data analysis/Analysis/output".
